Hi,

Thanks for signing up for a njvanhaute.com / Jambuster API account. I'm excited to have you on board!

You can use the same account for both the website and the backend API.

Please send a request to the `PUT /v1/users/activated` endpoint with the following JSON
body to activate your account:

{"token": "{{.activationToken}}"}

Please note that this is a one-time use token and it will expire in 3 days.

Thanks,

Nicholas
